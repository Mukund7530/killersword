<div id="points">1.Blade:</div>
Point (Tip): The sharp end of the blade used for thrusting attacks.
Edge: The cutting surface of the blade.

<div id="points">2.Hilt:</div>
Guard (Crossguard): Protects the hand from an opponent's blade and can have various shapes.
Quillons: The horizontal arms of the guard.
Handle (Grip): The part held by the wielder, usually made of wood, leather, or other materials.
Pommel: Counterbalances the blade, often weighted for balance.

<div id="points">3.Tang:</div>
Extended from the blade into the handle, the tang provides structural support and is often secured by a pommel.

<div id="points">4.Scabbard:</div>
A sheath or case used for protecting and carrying the sword when it's not in use.

<div id="points">5.Point of Balance:</div>
The spot on the blade where it can balance on a single point, influencing the sword's handling characteristics.

<div id="points">6.Distal Taper:</div>
Gradual reduction in thickness from the base to the tip of the blade.

<div id="points">7.Hilt Components:</div>
Grip Wrapping: The material covering the handle for a comfortable and secure hold.
Pommel Nut: Holds the pommel in place and secures the tang.

<div id="points">8.Ricasso:</div>
Unsharpened section of the blade, usually near the hilt, providing a safe area for the hand.

<div id="points">9.Forte and Foible:</div>
The stronger, thicker part of the blade near the hilt is called the forte, while the thinner part toward the tip is the foible.
components can vary based on the type of sword (e.g., katana, rapier, broadsword) and its intended use (e.g., thrusting, cutting). 
Different sword designs from various cultures may have unique features and names for these components.</pre>

  <h2>History of sword</h2>
  <br>
<p id="uses"><span id="high">The sword, a quintessential weapon with a rich history</span>, has served various purposes throughout human civilization. Initially 
    crafted for self-defense, swords evolved into symbols of prestige and authority. In ancient times, warriors wielded swords on the battlefield, displaying martial 
    prowess and skill. The sword's cutting edge made it a formidable tool for offense and defense, allowing skilled individuals to navigate through enemy lines with precision. As societies
     progressed, ceremonial swords became emblematic of honor and chivalry, often used in rituals
    , knighthood ceremonies, and other formal occasions. Beyond the military and ceremonial realms, swords found a place in
     traditional martial arts, where practitioners honed their discipline and mastery. In modern times, while swords are no longer a primary weapon on the battlefield, they persist as symbolic 
     artifacts, cherished for their historical significance and revered in the realms of art, literature, and popular culture. The enduring fascination with swords underscores their enduring 
     legacy as both practical tools and enduring symbols of courage and strength.
